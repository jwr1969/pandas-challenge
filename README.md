Observable trends based on the data

There a number of observable trends within the data:

1. Schools with a higher budget per student are the worst performing schools with the $645-675 category having an overall pass rate of only 53.5% compared to 90.37% for the lowest budget category. What’s surprising is that the higher budget schools are also the largest (2000-5000) and are not leveraging their size to reduce cost.
2. Large District schools are the worst performing. However, the only large Charter school is one of the better performing. So, it would appear that size in itself may not be the issue.
3. Charter schools make up the top 5 schools and large, District schools make up the bottom 5 schools.

Conclusion:

It appears that large District schools cost more and perform the poorest of all High Schools. Smaller and medium District schools and Charter Schools perform well. It should be noted that there may be other confounding data not considered: location, income, family stability, parents etc. that better explain the variation than size, budget and school type.

NB: I have provided 2 solutions to Scores by School Spending. One that gives the answers in the start doc and the other which, I believe, provides a more accurate picture.
